{-| Drop-in replacement for the `Html.Lazy` module from the `elm/svg` package.
Well, almost â€” the only difference is that there is no `lazy8` function.

{-| A performance optimization that delays the building of virtual DOM nodes.

Calling `(view model)` will definitely build some virtual DOM, perhaps a lot of
it. Calling `(lazy view model)` delays the call until later. During diffing, we
can check to see if `model` is referentially equal to the previous value used,
and if so, we just stop. No need to build up the tree structure and diff it,
we know if the input to `view` is the same, the output must be the same!
